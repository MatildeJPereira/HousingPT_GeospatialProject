# HousingPT_GeospatialProject

Geospatial analysis and spatial econometric modeling of housing prices across municipalities of Continental Portugal.

This repository contains the full code and report for the project developed within the course Geospatial Analysis and Representation for Data Science.

## Requirements

The project was developed using Python 3.13.

Required libraries:

- geopandas
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- folium
- libpysal
- esda
- spreg

You can install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install geopandas pandas numpy matplotlib folium libpysal esda spreg
```

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used:

- Housing prices (INE – Statistics on House Prices at Local Level, 2025)
- Population Census 2021 (INE)
- Income Tax Statistics 2023 (INE)
- Municipal boundaries (CAOP shapefiles)

The necessary resources that were taken from these datasets are already included in this repository.

## How to run the analysis

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependecies
3. Open the jupyter notebook
4. Run the notebook from top to bottom

## Interactive Map

The interactive map generated by the analysis is available at:

https://matildejpereira.github.io/HousingPT_GeospatialProject/

To regenerate the map locally, run the final cell of the notebook. The output will be saved as an HTML file.
